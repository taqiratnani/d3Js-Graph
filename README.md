# d3Js-Graph

PROJECT DETAILS
===============

A graph consist of connected nodes. Further nodes can be added also.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================

1. Download and configure any Apache server like wamp, xampp
2. Copy & place this 'd3Js-Graph' folder in www if you have configured wamp //D:\wamp\www\d3Js-Graph
3. Start wamp
4. Run it like localhost/d3Js-Graph in browser
5. To add a new node click on blue area
6. Just make sure that you are entering correct values as there is no validation applied
7. When saving file save and replace graph.json file
8. Refresh page to load new graph

FORM INPUT
==========

Name: Enter name which is not previously used like "d" as we already have (a, b, c)
Coordinates: Any
Target Node: Node number which is already in graph.json file like (1, 2, 3)

FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION
======================

What we can do next is ...

1. For now when we add a node it asks us to save file and we had to replace it with existing json file and load the page to reflect       changes. WE NEED TO AUTOSAVE THAT JSON FILE
   
2. For now we can just add nodes. ADD FUNCTIONALITY TO DELETE A NODE TOO
